# Test Environment Variables
#
# This file is used when running tests with Vitest
# Vite/Vitest automatically loads this file in test mode
#
# Variable Naming Convention:
# - All Vite environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_
#
# Usage in code:
# - Access via: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL
# - These are used during test execution

# API Base URL - Test Environment
# This URL is used in tests to ensure consistent test behavior
# Tests expect this localhost URL when mocking API calls
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

# Why localhost for tests?
# - Tests mock axios, so the actual URL doesn't matter for network calls
# - But tests assert that the correct URL is being used
# - Using localhost:8000 matches the expected test assertions
# - Keeps tests isolated from production/staging environments

# Production Environment Variables
#
# This file is used when building the frontend for production (npm run build)
# Vite automatically loads this file in production mode
#
# Variable Naming Convention:
# - All Vite environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_
# - Example: VITE_API_URL, VITE_APP_TITLE, etc.
#
# Usage in code:
# - Access via: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL
# - These are exposed to the frontend code at build time
# - They become part of the compiled JavaScript bundle

# API Base URL - Production Django Backend
# This URL points to your production backend server
# Used by frontend/src/services/api.ts for all API requests
VITE_API_URL=https://zohaib.no/api

# Note: Using domain name (zohaib.no) instead of IP address (18.217.70.110)
# Benefits:
# - Better SEO
# - SSL/HTTPS support
# - Professional appearance
# - Flexibility (can change server without updating code)

# Development Environment Variables
#
# This file is used when running the frontend in development mode (npm run dev)
# Vite automatically loads this file in development mode
#
# Variable Naming Convention:
# - All Vite environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_
# - Example: VITE_API_URL, VITE_APP_TITLE, etc.
#
# Usage in code:
# - Access via: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL
# - These are exposed to the frontend code during development

# API Base URL - Local Django Backend
# This URL points to your local development backend server
# Used by frontend/src/services/api.ts for all API requests
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

# Development Mode Benefits:
# - Fast development with hot module replacement
# - Local backend for testing without affecting production
# - CORS configured in Django settings (django-cors-headers)
# - No need to rebuild for every change

# To run the full stack locally:
# 1. Start Django backend:
#    cd backend
#    python manage.py runserver
#
# 2. Start Vue frontend (in another terminal):
#    cd frontend
#    npm run dev
#
# 3. Visit: http://localhost:5173 (Vite dev server)
#    API calls will proxy to: http://localhost:8000/api

# Optional: Use production backend for local development
# Uncomment the line below to test against production API locally
# VITE_API_URL=https://zohaib.no/api
